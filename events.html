                        <p>As a member of the Logistics Committee for the TAR UMT December IT Career Internship Fair
                            2023, I played a vital role in planning the event’s floor layout and assigning crew
                            schedules. My focus was on ensuring that every aspect of the event was meticulously
                            organized and under control, facilitating a smooth experience for both participants and
                            exhibitors. By coordinating logistics effectively, I contributed to creating a successful
                            career fair that provided valuable opportunities for students to connect with potential
                            employers and explore internship prospects in the IT industry.</p>
