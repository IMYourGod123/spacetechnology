                        <p>The SAS Curiosity Cup is a global analytics competition for student teams, offering a
                            platform to showcase skills in data science using SAS software. Teams of 2-4 students,
                            guided by a faculty advisor, select their own data-driven question to analyze. Judging
                            focuses on data preparation, analysis, and presentation, with the competition split into two
                            rounds: a paper submission and a video presentation. Winning teams are recognized for
                            excellence in data skills, gaining experience valuable for analytics careers.</p>

                        <h2>EHDEN Academy : Patient-Level Prediction</h2>
                        <p>This module provides a deep dive into patient-level prediction using OHDSI tools,
                            particularly ATLAS. Led by Jenna Reps, developer of the OHDSI Patient-Level Prediction
                            framework, the course covers best practices and key decision-making steps in the
                            standardized prediction process used by OHDSI and EHDEN. Participants will learn how to
                            develop, evaluate, and present prediction models while also focusing on defining relevant
                            large-scale prediction questions.</p>

                        <p>This module, led by Jenna Reps, provides hands-on training in using R for Patient-Level
                            Prediction (PLP) within the OHDSI framework. Participants will explore the OHDSI R PLP
                            library, learn to develop prediction models, and create and edit Prediction Study Packages
                            using ATLAS. The course also covers building R Packages for external model validation,
                            contributing study packages to the OHDSI-Studies GitHub repository, and enhancing the PLP
                            Package by adding new classifiers or features.</p>

                        <p>This course, developed by the International Consortium for Health Outcomes Measurement
                            (ICHOM), explores the principles of Value-Based Healthcare (VBHC) and its role in addressing
                            rising healthcare costs, improving patient outcomes, and reducing disparities. Participants
                            will learn about standardized, science-based measurement of patient-centered outcomes and
                            how these data can be used for benchmarking and performance-based care. The course includes
                            pre-recorded presentations and a self-assessment questionnaire, equipping learners with the
                            knowledge to define patient health outcomes and apply standardized measurement practices in
                            healthcare.</p>

                        <p>This module, presented by NICE (National Institute for Health and Care Excellence),
                            introduces the fundamentals of Health Technology Assessment (HTA)—the systematic evaluation
                            of healthcare technologies for clinical and cost-effectiveness. Participants will explore
                            key HTA concepts, common assessment approaches, and the role of real-world evidence (RWE) in
                            informing decisions. The course includes a case study on chronic obstructive pulmonary
                            disorder (COPD), showcasing how EHDEN was used in HTA processes. By the end, learners will
                            understand the purpose of HTA agencies, their methodologies, and how RWE enhances healthcare
                            decision-making. Prerequisites: EHDEN Foundation and Phenotype Definition, Characterisation,
                            and Evaluation courses.</p>
